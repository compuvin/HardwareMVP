# HardwareMVP
Modular Hardware Inventory solution that takes multiple inputs and compares the hardware that exists on all of them.

Requires MySQL 8.0
Script will prompt for server information and create the necessary tables.

This is very very alpha. Some things haven't even been tested yet. Come back soon to see a working solution.

I can use all the help I can get if anyone is interested!
